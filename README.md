# Plant Disease Detection using CNN

## 🧑‍🌾 Project Goal

The **Plant Disease Detection using CNN** project aims to help farmers by using deep learning models to detect plant diseases. By analyzing plant leaf images, the system identifies the type of disease affecting the plant and provides actionable recommendations to the farmer, such as pesticide usage or organic remedies. The ultimate goal is to enhance crop health, increase agricultural productivity, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## 🚀 Features

- **Disease Detection**: Automatically detects plant diseases from images of plant leaves.
- **Actionable Feedback**: Provides suggestions for treatment and care based on the disease detected.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high prediction accuracy using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit to make it easy for farmers to upload images and receive feedback.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Evaluation**: scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV (Headless for environments without a GUI)
- **User Interface**: Streamlit
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks
